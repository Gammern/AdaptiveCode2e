## **S**ingle responsibility principle
This is the S in SOLID.

* [SRP on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
* [srp.pdf](https://web.archive.org/web/20150202200348/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/srp.pdf)

Guess the principle is
* Modules, classes and methods should only have one responsibility
* Refactor whatever don't comply with the statement above

"If it ain't broke, don't fix it" in terms of working software do not apply here. 
Reduce software debt has higher priority.
